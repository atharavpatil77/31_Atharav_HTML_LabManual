<h1>The Art Of War by Sun Tzu - Page 12</h1>
<h2>Chapter 7 - Maneuvering</h2>
<p>
In all kinds of warfare, the direct approach is used for
attack, but the
oblique is what achieves victory. A general who understands
the use of the
oblique has a source of tactics as inexhaustible as Heaven
and Earth,
which, like the Rivers and the Oceans, will never run dry.
Like the Sun
and Moon, they diminish and then replenish; they constantly
renew
themselves like the cycle of the Four Seasons. There are only
five basic
notes in music, [12] but their variations are infinite. There
are only five
primary colours, [13] but when blended, their shades and hues
are limitless.
There are only five principal tastes, [14] but their
combinations produce
more flavours than can ever be tasted. In military strategy,
there is only
the direct and the oblique, but between them they offer an
inexhaustible
range of tactics. The direct and the oblique lead naturally
one into the
other, like an ever-turning wheel, so who can ever exhaust
their resource?
The surge of rolling flood-water washes away boulders: this
is called
momentum. The swoop of a falcon strikes and kills its prey:
this is called
timing. Thus for a skilled warrior, his momentum must be
irresistible and
his timing precise. Momentum is the tension in a crossbow
arm; timing is
the pulling of the trigger.
